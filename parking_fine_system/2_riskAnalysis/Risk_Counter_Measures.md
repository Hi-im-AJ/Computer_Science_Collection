There is a risk that a subtask will not be approved when compared with the specified requirements.

**Counter Measure:**

Use feature branches for every subtask and do review and revision before every merge with the master branch.

## Video Games

There is a risk that the project will be delayed because too much time is spend playing video games.

**Counter Measure:**

Use a reward system for limiting time spend playing video games. For every subtask completed 1hr of gaming will be rewarded. If no subtask has been completed, no gaming will be allowed.

## Unforeseen group work

There is a risk that a group assignment will require my focus during the project.

## Going to bed too late at night

There is a risk that my effectiveness when working will be reduced due to a lack of sleep and irregular sleep-wake cycles.

**Counter Measure:**

Set an alarm at 21:20 and then again at 21:50 to make sure I remember to go to bed. Setup an evening routine.

**Counter Measure:**

Go to sleep before 22:00 every day.

## Skipping a work day

Use the reward system to discourage skipping work. If nothing fun can replace work, work will be done.

## YouTube

There is a risk that my time will be spend towards watching youtube videos.

**Counter Measure:**

Use a reward system to discourage unearned leisure.
